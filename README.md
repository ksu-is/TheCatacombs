# TheCatacombs
A horror based text adventure. Can you escape the catacombs before the monster gets you?

Added both the foundation and edited code.
I am part of this project and have admin access

I added a knife element to the game, so if the player pick the right path they can fight their way out.
I added ahve also exapnded the dialgue to let the player knwo hter were other endings.
I added a bridge scene that hte player must get across, if the choose, and then blocked the exit back. I wanted some finality to the game.
I added a ladder escape option, and am currently working on a cultist murder end. I had to close one walkway as it was getting overwhleming.
The cultist room turned into three scenes as I needed a way for the character to be distracted, in a small room, and have cultist appear.
I did all the above by adding scenes by adding def statements and through else, if statements. 
I added a quit scene and an ending scene so the game does not automatically restart.
I have added the Powerpoint slide.
